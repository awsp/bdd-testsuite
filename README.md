Feature: Opening a site 
    As a Develop in Test
    I want to test run a site
    so I can verify all the URLs
    
Scenario: Open its URL
    Given I open the url "https://github.com"
    Then  I expect that the url is "https://github.com/"
    And   I expect that the title is "GitHub Â· Where software is built"
```
